 * Coordinates the execution flow of threads in atomic-actions through an
 * activity protocol which supports the notion of abortable tasks.
 * 
 * Participants signal their presence by calling arrived(). When completed
 * normally they call done() otherwise they call abort().
 * 
 * Getting "false" from done() means that all threads have completed
 * successfully and typically no further action needs to be taken. Getting
 * "true" however means that one or more threads have aborted their runs in
 * which case receiving threads need to take some "abort" or "rollback" action
 * and signal the fact that they themselves have aborted their runs by calling
 * abort().
 * 
 * TODO: done() can be changed to return an int to allow for a richer set of
 * error conditions.
