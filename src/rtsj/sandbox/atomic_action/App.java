 * A sample simulation of three threads participating in an atomic-action. When
 * testing, care must be taken to ensure all scenarios that reflect all possible
 * task histories are covered. Consider the following matrix for three threads,
 * for example, where "0" means task completed successfully and "1" means the
 * task failed: In addition to this, all potential finish outcomes need to be
 * taken into account (i.e. t2 finishes first, then t1 then t3 and so on). So,
 * for each row the following permutation of finish histories needs to be tested
 * (e.g. "t2t1t3" means t2 finishes first then t1 and then t2):
 * 
 * (t1t2t3, t1t3t2, t2t1t3, t2t3t1, t3t1t2, t3t2t1)
 * 
 * Note, some tests may be redundant but having them won't hurt.. ;-)
