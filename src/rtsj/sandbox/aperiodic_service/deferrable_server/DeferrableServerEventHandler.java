	/**
	 * The budget replenisher is a periodic thread
	 * (DeferrableServerBudgetReplenisher) which runs at a higher priority than this
	 * handler, preempts it and calls replenishBudget() on this object. When this
	 * happens there are two (notional) states this handler could be in: waiting, if
	 * it's budget has been exceeded or there are no more events to process or it
	 * could be running (note, it cannot have been preempted or blocked since it
	 * runs at a priority higher than the periodic task set and doesn't synchronise
	 * on any common resource). If it is running, then processing needs to be
	 * paused, the budget replenished and processing of the _same_ event resumed.
	 * 
	 * This becomes important when the events queue applies some ordering other than
	 * arrival time:
	 * 
	 * Assume (tc) is the current time, (tr) the next replenish time and the
	 * remaining server budget is (tr + a -tc) where tc < tr < (tr + a), so current
	 * processing would be pushed to just over the next replenish time. Then, if the
	 * remaining event cost is greater than (tr + a - tc) the event would be
	 * interrupted at tr, it would be put back into the queue (assuming it's
	 * restartable) and a newer event with a smaller cost (assuming ordering by
	 * cost) would effectively "preempt" it. To prevent this from happening, the
	 * event is interrupted upon each replenish event, the budget is replenished and
	 * the same event is subsequently restarted. This will guarantee a continuation
	 * in the handler's behaviour.
	 * 
	 * NOTE: The reason the above analysis is relevant is due to the fact that this
	 * application is compiled against a 1.1 version of the spec and relies on the
	 * resetTime(...) method of Timed class which resets the time for the _next_
	 * invocation of doInterruptible(..). The newest 2.0 spec supports a method
	 * called restart(...) which adjusts the timeout and restarts the timer _whilst_
	 * the Timed object is running, making interrupting the handling thread and
	 * checking the different interrupt types in events, redundant.
	 * 
	 * NOTE: Runs in memory area passed in the constructor.
	 * 
	 * NOTE: All small private methods should be inlined by the builder.
