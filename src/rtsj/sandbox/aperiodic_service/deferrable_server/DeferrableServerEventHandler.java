 * Together with DeferrableServerBudgetReplenisher forms a logical
 * implementation of the Deferrable-Server algorithm for aperiodic service.
 * Responsible for handling each aperiodic event and managing the aperiodic
 * events queue.
 * 
 * In order for the schedulability analysis to be correct under RM, it's
 * priority must be equal to the highest priority of the periodic task-set
 * running alongside this server (i.e. task with shortest period) _only_ if
 * priority ties are resolved in favour of the server. If they aren't, then this
 * server must be given a higher priority.
 * 
 * NOTE: This handler is a BoundAsyncEventHandler and is therefore given a
 * dedicated thread. Since a Deferrable Server is effectively one more task in
 * the entire task-set it is justifiable to not incur the overhead of attaching
 * a new thread to it every time it is called.
 * 
 * INVARIANTS:
 * 
 * 1) (remainingBudget >= 0) && (remainingBudget <= totalBudget)
 * 
 * OPEN QUESTIONS:
 * 
 * Does the handler need to be tied to one handling logic or be generic and
 * process any events? If the former then this handler must be configured with
 * one Interruptible implementation which allows an event to be set. If the
 * latter then the logic must be coded in the event object itself as it is done
 * in this implementation.
 * 
 * The question of which memory area events are created in hasn't been dealt
 * with at all. If excessive object creation is to be avoided then a recycling
 * Queue implemented based on the wait-free constructs should be provided.

	/**
	 * The budget replenisher is a periodic thread
	 * (DeferrableServerBudgetReplenisher) which runs at a higher priority than this
	 * handler, preempts it and calls replenishBudget() on this object. When this
	 * happens there are two (notional) states this handler could be in: waiting, if
	 * it's budget has been exceeded or there are no more events to process or it
	 * could be running (note, it cannot have been preempted or blocked since it
	 * runs at a priority higher than the periodic task-set and doesn't synchronise
	 * on any common resource other than itself with the replenisher). If it is
	 * running, then processing needs to be paused, the budget replenished and
	 * processing of the _same_ event resumed.
	 * 
	 * This becomes important when the events queue applies some ordering other than
	 * arrival time:
	 * 
	 * Assume (tc) is the current time, (tr) the next replenish time and the
	 * remaining server budget is (tr + a -tc) where tc < tr < (tr + a), so current
	 * processing would be pushed to just over the next replenish time. Then, if the
	 * remaining event cost is greater than (tr + a - tc) the event would be
	 * interrupted at tr, it would be put back into the queue (assuming it's
	 * restartable) and a newer event with say a smaller cost (assuming ordering by
	 * cost) would effectively "preempt" it. To prevent this from happening, the
	 * event is interrupted upon each replenish event, the budget is replenished and
	 * the same event is subsequently restarted. This will guarantee a continuation
	 * in the handler's behaviour. It can be argued that this is the desired
	 * behaviour when a specific queue sorting policy is in place but this approach
	 * perhaps provides better responsiveness for the currently processing event
	 * where replenishment is within it's execution interval.
	 * 
	 * NOTE: The reason the above analysis is relevant is due to the fact that this
	 * application is compiled against a 1.1 version of the spec and relies on the
	 * resetTime(...) method of Timed class which resets the time for the _next_
	 * invocation of doInterruptible(..). The newest 2.0 spec supports a method
	 * called restart(...) which adjusts the timeout and restarts the timer _whilst_
	 * the Timed object is running, making interrupting the handling thread and
	 * checking the different interrupt types in events, redundant.
	 * 
	 * NOTE: Runs in memory area passed in the constructor.
	 * 
	 * NOTE: All small private methods should be inlined by the builder.
