 * PATIENT MONITORING SYSTEM - REQUIREMENTS:
 * 
 * The system is arranged so that an interrupt is generated every time the
 * patient's heart beats. In addition, a mild electric shock can be administered
 * via a device control register, the address of which is 177760 (octal). The
 * register is set up so that every time an integer value x is assigned to it
 * the patient receives x volts over a a small period of time.
 * 
 * If no heartbeat is recorded within a 5 second period the patient's life is in
 * danger. Two actions should be taken when the patient's heart fails: the first
 * is that a 'supervisor' task should be notified so that it may sound the
 * hospital alarm and the second is that a single electric shock of 5 volts
 * should be administered. If the patient fails to respond, the voltage should
 * be increased by 1 volt for every further 5 seconds.
